Projects completed for Web Design Certification

This repository contains a folder with 4 of the web design projects I completed to receive a Web Design certificate from FreeCodeCamp's online Full-stack curriculum. 

Each of these four projects were developed ewith vanilla CSS3 and HTML5. I these projects in only CSS and HTML due to my prior inexperience with other front-end development libraries, as well as the layout of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. 

The project i'm most proud would be the Product Landing Page file. This provided me with some challenges regarding different layout techniques which took me a while to get used to. One of the most important things I learned while working on these front-end projects is how to document online resources and work through growing pains.
